# Pokemon RGB

*21-11-2022* to *02-12-2022*

Creation of a 2D game using SFML and C++. Collaboration with
[Thibaut](https://github.com/Loctryl) and
[Raphael](https://github.com/SmartNewt)

The project was made on Microsoft Visual Studio. 

The game will be a "Rogue-like" version of Pokemon : random map generation, random starter and 
almost no way of healing your pokemons. You'll have to be better.

## Game features

*to be implemented :*
* Pokemon combat
  * Capture a pokemon
  * Arena battle
* Dialogs with NPCs

*implemented :*
* Randomly generated map (Perlin Noise)
* Menu
* Pokemon combat
  * Heal your pokemons with sprays (no pokemon center)
  * Random pokemon encounter in the wild
* Inventory management

###Movements 

**GGeneral navigation :** Move in the game using the *UP*, *DOWN*, *RIGHT*, *LEFT* keys. You'll also need to use them when navigating in menus. Press *ENTER* to select an option in a menu. 

**Navigation in combat :** Navigate with *UP* and *DOWN* as usual but use *RIGHT* and *LEFT* to enter/exit a category. Press *ENTER* for the flee feature. 

## Instalation 

You will first need to install SFML, we will not explain here how to setup SFML on Microsoft Visual Studio. 

Being made on MVC++, it will not be compatible for Linux or MacOS, you will need MVC++ to run it, or adapt it.
